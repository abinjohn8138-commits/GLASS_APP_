# GLASS_APP_

The dataset originally comes from forensic investigations where determining the type of glass found at a crime scene can be crucial. Each glass sample includes its oxide content and is labeled with one of several glass types.

# Features

The dataset includes 9 numeric features, representing the chemical composition of glass:

*RI – Refractive Index

*Na – Sodium (percent in corresponding oxide, weight percent)

*Mg – Magnesium

*Al – Aluminum

*Si – Silicon

*K – Potassium

*Ca – Calcium

*Ba – Barium

*Fe – Iron

# Target Variable

*Glass Type (integer label)

#Typical classes include:

1, Building windows (float processed)

2, Building windows (non-float processed)

3,Vehicle windows

4, Containers

5, Tableware

6, Headlamps

# Use Cases

*Multiclass classification

*Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

*Feature importance & correlation studies

*Model benchmarking

*Forensic data modeling

# Source

This dataset is originally from the KAGGLE and widely used for academic and research purposes.
